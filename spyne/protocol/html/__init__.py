"""The ``spyne.protocol.html`` package contains various EXPERIMENTAL protocols
for generating server-side Html. It seeks to eliminate the need for html
templates by:
    #. Implementing standard ways of serializing Python objects to Html
        documents
    #. Implementing a very basic html node manipulation api in python instead
        of having to have pseudocode intertwined within Html. (Ã  la PHP)

As you can probably tell, not everything is figured out yet :)

Initially released in 2.8.0-rc.

This module is EXPERIMENTAL. You may not recognize the code here next time you
look at it.
