The test modules are also executables. tests can be run simply by executing test
modules. A more pleasant way to run tests is to use py.test. easy_install pytest 
to get it and run:

py.test -v --tb=short

in the test directory.

Some tests are standalone, but some are not.

To run all of the tests, you must:
1) launch every server in rpclib.test.interop.server.
2) get wsi-interop-tools and unpack it next to test_wsi.py. Here are the
relevant links:

See also test_wsi.py for more info.
