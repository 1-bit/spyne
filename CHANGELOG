Change Log

soaplib-2
* This release transformed soaplib from a soap server that exclusively supported
http to a soap serialization/deserialization library that is architecture and
transport agnostic.
* Sphinx docs with working examples: http://arskom.github.com/soaplib/2_0/
* Serializers renamed to Models 
* Standalone xsd generation for ClassSerializer objects has been added. This allows soaplib to be used to define generic XML schemas, without SOAP artifacts.
* Annotation Tags for primitive Models has been added.
* The soaplib client has been re-written after having been dropped from recent releases. It follows the suds API but is based on lxml for better performance. WARNING: the soaplib client is not well-tested and future support is tentative dependent on community response.
* 0mq support added. 
* Twisted supported via WSGI wrappers.
* Hard dependency on WSGI removed.
* Increased test coverage for soaplib and supported servers
